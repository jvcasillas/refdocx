## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This is another paragaph of text. I want to see how indentation works.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` {r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

``` {r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is a caption!"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent
printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## More demos

### Include a table

```{r warps}
knitr::kable(head(warpbreaks, 10), caption = "10 rows")
```
